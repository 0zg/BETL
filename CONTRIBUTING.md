How to contribute to BETL

Did you find a bug?

Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under Issues.

If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one. Be sure to include a title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible, and a code sample or an executable test case demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

please include relevant full logging and sql:
exec betl.def.setp 'exec_sql', 0
exec betl.def.setp 'log_level', 'VERBOSE' 

Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?

Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

Before submitting, please read the Contributing to BETL to know more about coding conventions and benchmarks.

Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?

Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?

Suggest your change in the betl-core mailing list and start writing code.

Do not open an issue on GitHub until you have collected positive feedback about the change. GitHub issues are primarily intended for bug reports and fixes.

Do you have questions about the source code?

contact me via email.
I welcome all kinds of feedback.
