# betl

Welcome to BETL, the open source ETL generation engine. 

# Update
Currently I am working to integrate GDPR (general data protection regulation) reporting into betl. Because BETL is meta data based adding lineage is relatively easy, however this can be tricky when using stored procedures, views or ssis to transform your data. Nevertheless we have done a pretty good job at discovering most dependencies including SSAS Tabular Cube meta data and Active directory. (Send me an email for more info..)
